# Health-Seeker-Backend

**Health-Seeker-Backend** is a FastAPI-based backend system designed to demonstrate scalable API development with background workers, event-driven subscribers, and structured data flows.

The project simulates a **healthcare data orchestration layer**, showcasing how modern APIs can support regulated industries like healthcare.

## ðŸ”¹ Key Features

- **FastAPI-powered REST APIs** â€“ Secure, role-based endpoints for patients, doctors, and admins.  
- **Background Workers** â€“ Async task queues (Celery/Redis or FastAPI BackgroundTasks) for handling long-running processes such as appointment scheduling, health data analysis, or sending notifications.  
- **Subscribers & Event Handlers** â€“ Pub/Sub-style components that listen to data changes (e.g., new patient record created, lab results updated) and trigger follow-up actions.  
- **Database Integration** â€“ PostgreSQL with Pydantic models for validation and schema consistency.  
- **Real-time Updates** â€“ WebSocket endpoints or status tracking APIs for monitoring background tasks.  
- **Dockerized Deployment** â€“ Ready-to-run containers for APIs and workers.  
- **Swagger/OpenAPI Documentation** â€“ Auto-generated interface for testing endpoints.

## ðŸ”¹ Use Case Example

1. A patient books an appointment via API.  
2. A **worker** schedules the appointment asynchronously and notifies the doctor.  
3. A **subscriber** listens for updates and logs the event into a secure audit trail.

This project illustrates how a **scalable, event-driven backend** can support healthcare or any industry requiring **robust APIs, async workflows, and real-time feedback**.
